      "ruleVulnDiscussion": "CJCSM 6510.01B, \"Cyber Incident Handling Program\", in subsection e.(6)(c) sets forth three requirements for Cyber events detected by an automated system:\nIf the cyber event is detected by an automated system, an alert will be sent to the POC designated for receiving such automated alerts.\nCC/S/A/FAs that maintain automated detection systems and sensors must ensure that a POC for receiving the alerts has been defined and that the IS configured to send alerts to that POC.\nThe POC must then ensure that the cyber event is reviewed as part of the preliminary analysis phase and reported to the appropriate individuals if it meets the criteria for a reportable cyber event or incident.\n\nBy immediately displaying an alarm message, potential security violations can be identified more quickly even when administrators are not logged on to the network device. An example of a mechanism to facilitate this would be through the utilization of SNMP traps.\n\nThe Palo Alto Networks security platform can be configured to send messages to an SNMP server and to an email server as well as a Syslog server. SNMP traps can be generated for each of the five logging event types on the firewall: traffic, threat, system, hip, config. For this requirement, only the threat logs must be sent. Note that only traffic that matches an action in a rule will be logged and forwarded. In the case of traps, the messages are initiated by the firewall and sent unsolicited to the management stations. \n\nThe use of email as a notification method may result in a very larger number of messages being sent and possibly overwhelming the email server as well as the POC. The use of SNMP is preferred over email in general, but organizations may want to use email in addition to SNMP for high-priority messages.",
